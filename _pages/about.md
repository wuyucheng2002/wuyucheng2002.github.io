Currently, I am a PhD student in the School of Computer Science, Peking University from Sep. 2023, supervised by Prof. [Leye Wang](https://wangleye.github.io). 

Before that, I received my B.E. degree from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 2023, supervised by Prof. [Xiao Han](http://simecv.sufe.edu.cn/page.aspx?id=54). 

My research mainly focuses data mining, especially for graph data, including privacy protection techniques and representation methods.
