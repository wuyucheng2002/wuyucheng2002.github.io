Currently, I am a PhD student in School of Computer Science, Peking University from Sep. 2023, supervised by Prof. [Leye Wang](https://wangleye.github.io). 

Before that, I received my BEng degree from School of Information Management and Engineering, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in July, 2023, supervised by Prof. [Xiao Han][http://simecv.sufe.edu.cn/page.aspx?id=54]. 

My research mainly focuses graph data mining, including privacy protection and graph representation methods.
