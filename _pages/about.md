Currently, I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Computer Science, Peking University from Sep. 2023, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://wangleye.github.io" target="_blank">Leye Wang</a>. 

Before that, I received my B.E. degree from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 2023, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://simecv.sufe.edu.cn/page.aspx?id=54" target="_blank">Xiao Han</a>.
